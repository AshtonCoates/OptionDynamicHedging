# Option Dynamic Hedging
This is a personal project exploring implementing an algorithm for dynamic hedging of options contracts. This strategy entails continually buying and selling the underlying contract of an option at some interval to maintain delta neutrality over the entire life of the option.

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm that can execute the dynamic hedging strategy given an option contract, date of purchase, and interval of adjustment.
